We need your help to figure out how much fuel our different engines need for our engine tests based on time. 
In order to calculate this, we will use the following equation where fuel is measured in kilograms:

`fuelRequired = fuelPerSecond * burnTime`

Write a program that asks the user for the fuel per second that the engine uses at full thrust and the duration of the burn. 
It should calculate the amount of fuel required for the test. 
Make sure that the program closes after the calculation is complete.

Things you will need to pass the tests:

- Prompt 1: "How many kilograms of fuel does the engine use per second?"
- Prompt 2: "For how many seconds will the engine be on?"
- Formula: `fuelRequired = fuelPerSecond * burnTime`
- Output: "You need `[fuelRequired]` kilograms of fuel."
